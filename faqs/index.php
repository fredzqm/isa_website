                      The goal of the International Student Association (ISA) is to gather both international and non-international students, staff, and faculty to initiate an environment of cultural learning and promote international understanding, friendship, and goodwill.  Throughout the year, we will provide opportunities for campus community members to broaden their horizons of knowledge and become better acquainted with diversity and foreign culture through activities and campus involvement.

In addition to our goals, we make it a priority to help our international students feel comfortable and make Rose-Hulman a place they can call their second home.  We also provide opportunities for both international and non-international students who are interested in studying abroad.
